I always dreamed of having a restaurant with 15 options on the menu, but I don’t know what I want to put on it. I’ve decided to ask you to create the items and decide how much they’ll cost because I'm not very creative. I need 5 appetizers, 5 entrees, and 5 desserts. And then the restaurant will begin taking orders. We are only willing to take 20 orders from the drive through. Customers are only able to
order 1 item. Every time a car pulls up the drive through worker will have a script to read and the menu must appear.

After all 20 orders happen, a summary must appear with this information:
* Total money made
* Percentage of sales for each item.
* A list of items ordered with the number of times they’re ordered.
